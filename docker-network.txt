Docker network

#when we command ip a, we can see docker0

#when we install docker , that time docker0 installed and gives ipaddress  series , 
containers gives ip address with this series only
ip a


#how to create network
docker network create jyotinetwork

docker run -d -P --name db --jyotinetwork redis
docker run -d -P --name db --jyotinetwork busybox:1.28 sleep 3600


#why we need this network 
#one container can not communicate with other container with id or name if we go for default network
#In some cases, we need to communicate with other container ... eg. db

#if we create network and 
use the created network to run conatiners 
then they can communication with each other with name of container and ip of container

#in case of docker swarm we should not worry about network as in docker swarm 
it is mainly using overlay network
docker network ls
